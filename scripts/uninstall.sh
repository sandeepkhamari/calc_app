// This script is used to uninstall the installed files.
// You can run it from your build directory.
rm -rf install
// Note: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute this command and that your environment is set up correctly for CMake.
// Also, make sure to adjust paths and commands based on your specific project structure and requirements.
// This script assumes you are using a Unix-like shell. If you are on Windows, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.
// For Windows, you might use a batch script (.bat) or PowerShell script (.ps1) instead.
// For example, in a batch script, you would replace `rm -rf` with `rmdir /s /q` and adjust other commands as needed.
// This script is a basic example and may need to be modified to fit your specific use case.
// Always review and test scripts in a safe environment before using them in production.
// Additionally, consider adding error handling to the script to manage potential issues during the uninstall process.
// This can include checking the exit status of the command and providing informative messages to the user.
// For example, you can use `if` statements in bash to check if a command was successful and handle errors accordingly.
// Finally, remember to keep your CMakeLists.txt files updated to reflect any changes in your project structure or dependencies.
// This ensures that the uninstall process remains smooth and that all components are correctly removed.
// Regularly testing the uninstall process can help catch issues early and maintain a reliable development workflow.
// If you are working in a team, consider sharing this script and any relevant documentation to help others understand and use the uninstall process effectively.
// Collaboration and clear communication are key to successful project management and development.
// Happy coding! Make sure to adapt the script as your project evolves and new requirements arise
