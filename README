// This file provides an overview of the project structure and instructions for building and running the project.
// C++ Calculator Project
// This project implements a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations and additional functionalities.
// Project Structure:
// - addition/: Contains the Addition class for performing addition operations.
// - subtraction/: Contains the Subtraction class for performing subtraction operations.
// - multiplication/: Contains the Multiplication class for performing multiplication operations.
// - division/: Contains the Division class for performing division operations.
// - circle/: Contains the Circle class for calculating the area of a circle.
// - power/: Contains the Power class for exponentiation.
// - square/: Contains the Square class for calculating the area of a square.
// - sum/: Contains the Sum class for calculating the summation of integers.
// - test/: Contains unit tests for the Addition and Subtraction classes using Google Test framework.
// - main.cpp: The main application file that demonstrates the usage of the calculator functionalities.
// - CMakeLists.txt: The CMake build configuration file.
// - scripts/: Contains shell scripts for building, installing, and running the project.
// Building and Running the Project:
// 1. Ensure you have CMake and a C++ compiler installed on your system.
// 2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
// 3. Navigate to the project directory and create a build directory:
//    mkdir build
//    cd build
// 4. Run CMake to configure the project:
//    cmake ..
// 5. Build the project using CMake:
//    cmake --build .
// 6. To install the built files, run:
//    cmake --install . --config debug
// 7. To run the calculator application, navigate to the install/bin directory and execute:
//    ./calc_app.exe
// 8. To run the unit tests, use CTest from the build directory:
//    ctest --output-on-failure -C debug
// Note: The project uses the C++17 language standard version.
// For any issues or contributions, please refer to the project's GitHub repository.
